### Programming Assignment 2-5
Write a program (called Prog5) that asks the user to input a String. The output is the
characters of this String in reverse order, which should be written to the console. (For
example, if the input string is "Hello", the ouptut string would be "olleH".) (Do not use
arrays and do not create a new String object. In particular, you may not use Java library
functions that peform the reverse operation for you, such as the reverse functions found
in StringBuilder and StringBuffer.)
After you have Prog5 working properly, write a batch file that can be used to run your
program – call it prog5.bat (see Lesson 1 for details about how this is done). Place your
batch file in a special folder on your hard drive – you could create a foler called
batchFiles for this purpose; if you execute prog5.bat from this location, it should be able
to locate and run Prog5.

## Programming Assignment 2-7
Write a program that generates a random set of 8 addition problems (intended for a child
in elementary school). Numbers to be added should be randomly chosen from the range
1..99. Each run of the program should result in a different set of problems (actually, there
is a tiny probablity that two runs of the program will produce the same set of problems,
but I donâ€™t expect anyone will encounter this). Console output should be formatted like
this:
  8    23   31   99
+ 10 + 17 + 9 +  42
_____ ____ ____ ____
  83   67  39    5
+ 17 + 7 + 19 + 49
_____ ____ ____ ____

### Programming Assignment 3-1
Below, a class Account is defined, and the class Employee, as defined in the lecture, is shown.
```
class Account {
public final static String CHECKING = "checking";
public final static String SAVINGS = "savings";
public final static String RETIREMENT = "retirement";
private final static double DEFAULT_BALANCE = 0.0;
private double balance;
private String acctType;
private Employee employee;
Account(Employee emp, String acctType, double balance){
employee = emp;
this.acctType =acctType;
this.balance = balance;
}
Account(Employee emp, String acctType){
this(emp,acctType,DEFAULT_BALANCE);
}
public String toString() {
return "type = " + acctType + ", balance = " + balance;
}
public void makeDeposit(double deposit) {
//implement
}
public boolean makeWithdrawal(double amount) {
//implement
}
}
public class Util {
public static String dateAsString(Date d) {
DateFormat f = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.SHORT);
return f.format(d);
}
}
//same as the Employee class defined in the lecture
public class Employee {
// instance fields
private String name;
private String nickName;
private double salary;
private Date hireDay;
// constructor
public Employee(String aName, String aNickName,
double aSalary, int aYear, int aMonth, int aDay) {
name = aName;
nickName = aNickName;
salary = aSalary;
GregorianCalendar cal =
new GregorianCalendar(aYear, aMonth - 1, aDay);
hireDay = cal.getTime();
}
// instance methods
public String getName() {
return name;
}
public String getNickName() {
return nickName;
}
public void setNickName(String aNickName) {
nickName = aNickName;
}
public double getSalary() {
return salary;
}
// needs to be improved
public Date getHireDay() {
return hireDay;
}
public void raiseSalary(double byPercent) {
double raise = salary * byPercent / 100;
salary += raise;
}
private String format = "name = %s, salary = %.2f, hireDay = %s";
public String toString() {
return String.format(format, name, salary, Util.dateAsString(hireDay));
}
}
```
The Employee class discussed in the lecture is reproduced here. To create an instance of
Account, you must pass in an Employee and a String name for an account type, and,
optionally, the starting balance. If you do not specify a starting balance, then the default balance
(which is defined by a constant, and initially set to the value 0.0) is used. The possible kinds of
account type are indicated by three public constants â€“ CHECKING, SAVINGS, and
RETIREMENT. These constants should always be used whenever an account type needs to be
specified by name.
In this assignment, do the following:
1. Refactor the Account class so that the three account types CHECKING, SAVINGS,
   RETIREMENT, are the three instances of an enumerated type called AccountType;
   like Java classes, the enum should be placed in a separate file. After defining this enum
   and removing the account types from the Account class, make the necessary changes to
   instance variables and the constructors of Account.
2. Add the following methods to the Account class:
   //updates the balance field
   public void makeDeposit(double val);
   //updates the balance field and returns true, unless
   //withdrawal amount is too large; in that case,
   //it does not modify the balance field, and returns false
   public boolean makeWithdrawal(double amount)
3. Add public accessor methods for the fields acctType and balance.
4. Correct the implementation of getHireDay() in Employee, as discussed in the lecture.
5. Create a class Main having a main method that does the following:
   a. It creates a new Employee object employee (you can invent your own name,
   hireday, salary, etc., to be used in the constructor)
   b. Then it creates a checking account, savings account and retirement account for
   employee, each with a starting balance of $300.
   c. Then it prints to the console the account data for each of these accounts (making
   use of the toString() method that has been provided in Account)

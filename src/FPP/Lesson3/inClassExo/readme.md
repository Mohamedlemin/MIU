### Exercise 3.3
Create a Java class that keeps track of how many
instances of itself have been created. This data should be
stored in a (static) variable and should be accessible by a
public accessor method (this should be an instance
method, not a static method). Write a main method that
constructs several instances of the class and then
outputs the number of instances created by calling this
accessor method.

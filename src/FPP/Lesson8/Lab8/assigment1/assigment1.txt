Programming Assignment 8-1
Include versions of the methods in MinSort and BinSearchIterative in your
MyStringList class. The code for these algorithms, as applied to integer arrays, is in a
folder in this directory. (Remember that you already included sorting in your
MyStringList in one of the in-class exercises. You may re-use that work here.) Include in
your main method the following tests for your sorting and searching methods:
a. Sort the following list
["big", "small", "tall", "short", "round", "square",
"enormous", "tiny","gargantuan", "lilliputian",
"numberless", "none", "vast", "miniscule"]

b. Take the list sorted in part a. and attempt binary searches for each of the
following:
• "number"
• "tiny"

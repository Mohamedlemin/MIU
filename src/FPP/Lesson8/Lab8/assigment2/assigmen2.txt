Programming Assignment 8-2
Use the class MyStringLinkedList in the source folder for this lab as a starting point
for implementing a doubly linked list (with header) for use with String data.
Implement the operations:
//inserts a new Node containing data so that its
//position in the list is now pos
void insert(String data, int pos)
//attempts to remove the first Node that contains
//data; if successful, returns true; otherwise, false.
boolean remove(String data)
Also, implement the methods in MinSort in this new context. Test your sort method as
in 8-1, using the following:
Sort the following list
["big", "small", "tall", "short", "round", "square",
"enormous", "tiny","gargantuan", "lilliputian",
"numberless", "none", "vast", "miniscule"]
Hint: For sorting, replace the swap method for arrays with
void swap(Node n1, Node n2),
which appears to switch the positions of n1 and n2 in the list with the following
trick: it switches the values stored in the two nodes. (It is possible to actually
swap the positions of the nodes by rearranging links, but it is tricky and not
needed for this lab.)
And replace the minpos method (which finds the position of the min value) with
Node minNode(Node n)
which returns the Node nested in n that has the minimum value.

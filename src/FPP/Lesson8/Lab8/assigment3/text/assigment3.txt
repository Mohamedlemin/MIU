Programming Assignment 8-3
In the sample code in the supplementary code folder, there are classes Employee,
NameComparator, and EmployeeSort in the employeesort package.
Add code according to the following specifications:
1. Create a SalaryComparator class whose compareTo method orders
Employee objects in increasing order of salary.
2. Create a HireDateComparator class whose compareTo method orders
Employee objects in increasing date of hire.
3. Write additional code in the EmployeeSort constructor which, after the “sort by
name” operation is done and outputs results to the console (code has already been
written), then sorts by salary, outputs results to the console, and then sorts by hire
date, and outputs to console.
4. Make sure your Comparator implementations are consistent with equals.

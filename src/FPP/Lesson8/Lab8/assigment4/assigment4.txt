Programming Assignment 8-5
An array allows you to match objects of a particular type with integer indices. For
instance, the array ["Harry", "Jim", "Sally"] matches 0 with "Harry", 1 with
"Jim", and 2 with "Sally".
Create a class MyTable that will allow you to match objects of String type with a
character index (where, for this lab, we will just use the characters ‘a’ – ‘z’). Your class
should be able to be used like this:
MyTable t = new MyTable();
t.add('a', "Andrew");
t.add('b',"Billy");
t.add('c',"Charlie");
String s = t.get('b');
System.out.println(s);
//output
Billy
Implement MyTable by creating an inner class Entry whose constructor has the
following signature:
Entry(char c, String s)
As an instance variable in MyTable, store an array with the following intialization:
Entry[] entries = new Entry[26];
Each of the 26 Entry instances corresponds to one of the lower case characters of the
alphabet – 'a' through 'z'.
The add method will compute the position in the entries array that corresponds to the
character passed in, and will create an Entry object to place into that position.
For example, if a call
add('b', "Billy")
is made, the add method will compute that 'b' corresponds to position 1 in the entries
array. It will then create a new Entry instance, passing in the pair ('b',"Billy"), and place
that new Entry instance in position 1 of the entries array.
Entry and MyTable should also each implement a toString method
public String toString()
The toString method in Entry should join the contents of its character and String
variables with an arrow, as in the following:
a->Andrew
The toString method of MyTable should adjoin the output of repeated calls to the
toString method of the objects stored in the Entry[] array.
Here is an example of how it should look: If the following appears in the main method:
MyTable t = new MyTable();
t.add('a', "Andrew");
t.add('b',"Billy");
t.add('w',"Willie");
System.out.println(t);
then the output should look like this:
a->Andrew
b->Billy
w->Willie

creating.
